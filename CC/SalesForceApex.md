To create an application in Salesforce.com using the Apex programming language, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your Salesforce Developer account:
   - Go to the Salesforce Developer website (https://developer.salesforce.com) and sign in with your Salesforce credentials. If you don't have an account, create one.

2. Navigate to the Salesforce Setup:
   - Once logged in, click on your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Developer Console" from the dropdown menu.
   - The Developer Console will open in a new browser tab.

3. Create an Apex Class:
   - In the Developer Console, go to File > New > Apex Class.
   - Provide a name for your class and click "OK".
   - A new Apex class file will open in the editor.

4. Write Apex code:
   - In the Apex class file, write your Apex code to define your application's functionality.
   - Apex is similar to Java and follows an object-oriented programming model.
   - You can create classes, methods, variables, and utilize Salesforce APIs and objects to interact with data and perform operations.

5. Save and Compile the Apex Class:
   - Once you've written the Apex code, click on File > Save to save the Apex class file.
   - Salesforce will automatically compile the Apex code and check for any syntax errors.

6. Create an Apex Trigger (optional):
   - If your application requires automation based on specific events, such as record creation or update, you can create an Apex trigger.
   - To create an Apex trigger, go to File > New > Apex Trigger in the Developer Console.
   - Provide a name for your trigger and select the object and events on which it should execute.
   - Write the Apex trigger code and save it.

7. Test your Apex code:
   - To test your Apex code, click on the "Test" tab in the Developer Console.
   - Write test methods to validate the behavior and functionality of your Apex classes.
   - Execute the tests to ensure your code works as expected.

8. Deploy your Application:
   - Once you are satisfied with your Apex code and it passes the tests, you can deploy it to your Salesforce org.
   - To deploy your Apex code, you can use various deployment tools like Salesforce CLI or Metadata API.
   - Follow the appropriate deployment process to deploy your application to your Salesforce org.

9. Use and Customize your Application:
   - After deployment, your application will be available in your Salesforce org.
   - You can access it through the Salesforce user interface and customize it further based on your requirements.
